As a player (AAP), I want to see a welcome message at the start:

    (print the message below at the very start of the code, easy)

  ----------------------
  Let's play Py-Pac-Poe!
  ----------------------

  (prompt user for a move - input function. the value would be a coordinate - b2 - store all the possible coordinates in a dictionary(?) or list, store the player selected coordinate in a different dictionary/list.

  use a function to determine whos turn it is, like we used for connect 4. 1 or -1. multiply the value by -1 each round to change the turn

  take the user input value, b2, and then place a symbol in that location on the board depending on whos turn it is. have to account for if the coordinate has already been chosen. if so, user cannot select that field. maybe initalize the values as null, and if the value is still null, then the move can be made? but not sure if they can be initalized to null in python. have to check

  after every move, print the board again, with the updated changes


       A      B      C
	
  1)  (A1) | (B1) | (C1) 
     -------------------
  2)  (A2) | (B2) | (C2) 
     -------------------
  3)  (A3) | (B3) | (C3) 



  store all winning combinations in a dictionary. Iterate over player dictionaries to see if their selected moves equal a winning combination of moves. use this for win logic. if game is won, game is over, board is locked

  also create logic for a tie
  )


AAP, before being prompted for a move, I want to see the board printed out in the console, so that I know what moves have been made:

      A   B   C
	
  1)  X |   | O 
     -----------
  2)    | X |  
     -----------
  3)  X | O | O 
	  
AAP, I want to be prompted with which player’s move it is.

AAP, I want to be prompted on how to enter a valid move so that I don’t make mistakes:

      A   B   C
	
  1)  X |   | O 
     -----------
  2)    | X |  
     -----------
  3)  X | O | O 
	
  Player X's Move (example B2):  
AAP, I want to be able to enter my move’s column letter in upper or lower case (a/A, b/B or c/C) to make it easier to enter my move.

AAP, if I enter a move in an invalid format, or if I try to occupy a cell already taken, I want to see a message chastising me and be re-prompted:

  Player X's Move (example B2): Z9
  Bogus move! Try again...
	
  Player X's Move (example B2):
AAP, at the end of a game I want to see who won the game:

  Player X wins the game!
or if it was a tie

  Another tie!
